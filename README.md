# Wil-Spade: A crime noir novel. 
An attempt at creating a noir novel with my friends. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Authors: Patrick Costa

Goal Outline: In this novel I will work with three of my close friends to craft a fun collaborative model.

Perspective: As a crime noir novel it will have a certain kind of speech pattern. Should have 100% voice over dialogue for it
to be a true noir.  

Charactors: Wil Spade, private eye, Sal, bartender, "The Russian" and "The Dame".
